We added checking of country airports files (airports-*.xml). We declare 
several VALUE CONSTRAINTS, represented by <value> elements. A <value> element 
specifies an expression (typically: XPath expression, @exprXP) and declares 
constraints which apply to the expression value (@eq, @lt, @matches, @distinct, 
@datatype, ...).

The expression is evaluated in the context of the target resource. More 
precisely, it is evaluated in the context of the root node of the resource, 
unless the constraint has a <focusNode> ancestor. Note that an understanding
of the evaluation context is crucial for writing Greenfox schemas, and it
is a topic with a few subtleties. The paper which you find as part of the
tutorial material devotes a section to it.

Every constraint can be associated with an "error message" (@eqMsg, @ltMsg 
etc.). The messages are represented by attributes with a name obtained by 
appending the suffix "Msg" to the name of the constraint node (e.q. @eqMsg).  
Success messages are also possible, they have the name suffix "MsgOK". (Not
used in this example.)
    
TIP: Quite important are cardinality constraints (@count, @minCount, @maxCount), 
as without them a typo may lead to an empty result which "passes" all kinds 
of constraints!

In order to make expression writing as easy as possible, the Value constraint
type supports options for controlling details of expression evaluation which,
in principle, could be taken take of by the expression itself, making it more
unwieldy. So before comparison, items may be CAST to a datatype specified by @useDatatype,
or EDITED as specified by @useString - e.g. set to lower-case ('lc'),
whitespace-normalised ('ns') or trimmed ('tr').

Equally important: if such details would be squeezed into the expression
itself, the constraint would be less declarative, as technical aspects would
distract from the logic of the constraint - e.g. equality of two items.

Similarly, it is a constraint parameter which controls whether all or only
at least one item must conform to the condition: an attribute @quant set
to "some" means "at least one". The attribute value "all" is the default - 
by default, all items must conform.
