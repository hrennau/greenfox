We submit the index document to XSD validation, and we check that all href
links can be recursively resolved. Recursive resolution means that for each
link target new link targets are sought, using the same Link Definition,
until no new link targets can be found.

Concerning the XSD validation note that the constraint does not specify
a particular XSD, just a folder. The Greenfox processor inspects all
XSDs and finds the one to use for this document, or reports an error
if not exactly one XSD is found.

We have reached the end of our guided tour. Perhaps the most important
point was to perceive the brick and mortar of Greenfox - shapes 
containing constraints and connecting them to a target declaration.
You have seen how for each shape a target is found by evaluating a
target declaration in a context which is a resource from the target
of the parent shape. You have a rought understanding how Greenfox 
schemas are structured and how their processing can be viewed as
as recursive descent over its shaps. Now you are ready for a closer 
look at key principles as well as interesting details. Thank you 
for following me up to here!
