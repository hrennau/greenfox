Our first Greenfox schema. It VISITs a single resource - the airports index
folder, and it CHECKs its contents, using a FolderContent constraint. 

The constraint is represented by a <folderContent> element, with child
elements describing the folder members. Member names may use wildcards. 
Default cardinality is 1..1. Use @minCount, @maxCount or @count to 
specify other constraints. If @closed is used, the folder must not 
contain members which do not match any of the name attributes.

You can also specify the expected MD5, SHA1 oder SHA256. Use an attribute
with the corresponding name. 
    
Launch validation with a command like this:
   gfox /path/to/air01.xml
   
Use different options for changing the report type, e.g.:
   gfox /path/to/air01.xml -r
   
Report type options:   
-1   summary report, only constraint statistics
-2   as before, but red resources are listed (default report type)
-3   as before, but also green resources are listed
-r   list result elements for all red resources
-w   list all result elements
