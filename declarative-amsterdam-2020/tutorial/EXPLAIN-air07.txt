We follow the href links, visit the link targets and validate their tree structure.

A DocTree constraint specifies "tree templates" - structures which must be matched
by the actual resource contents. Note that the trees can be subtrees - the root 
element can be any content node. The parent-child relationships in the model trees
are virtual: every model node is tied to its model parent by a navigation which is
specified by @locNP. The navigation may or may not be a parent-child navigation.
So you can construct logical trees which differ from physical trees and check
conformance of the resources to those logical trees.

Note, for example the virtual child nodes with @locNP "temporal/timezone" - they are 
descendants treated as child.
