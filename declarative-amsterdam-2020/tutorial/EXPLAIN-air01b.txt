Same validation as in air01.gfox.xml, but more compact notation, using plural
forms; the @names attribute is a whitespace-separated list of file names or
name patterns. 
    
Note that the cardinality constraints apply to each item in the names list 
independently. In order to watch this logic, you might experiment and change 
the @maxCount value to '3'.
