<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of FolderSimilar constraints. Folder similarity means that the lists
    of member names, modified as described below, are equal. Member contents are not inspected.
    
    The target folder is compared with folder(s) selected by a Link Definition ("link target folders"). 
    The constraint contains a local Link Definition or references a global definition by name 
    (@linkName). Here, the Link Definition is local, consisting of a Foxpath expression (@foxpath).
    
    When comparing folders, files and sub folders found in only one of the two folders being
    compared are ignored if they match a name pattern from the name patterns specified by 
    skipFiles/@names or skipFolders/@names, respectively. Any number of <skipFiles> and 
    <skipFolders> elements is allowed. They may have a @where attribute with possible values 
    'here' and 'there': if 'here', the matching files or folders are only ignored if occurring 
    in the target folder ('here') or in the link target folder ('there').
    
    In this example, any files *.sav.* are ignored, and any *.sav folders are ignored if occurring 
    in the target folder.
