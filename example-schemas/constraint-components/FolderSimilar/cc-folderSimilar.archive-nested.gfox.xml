<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of FolderSimilar constraints. This example checks resources
    contained by an archive file. 
    
    Here, the domain folder itself is contained by an archive, and the folder with which 
    to compare is contained by a nested archive (archive within the domain folder which
    is contained by an archive). 
    
    Note that there is no difference compared with checking normal file system resources - 
    dealing with archive contents is just a detail of navigation used to provide the 
    resources involved.
